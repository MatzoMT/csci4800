**Short Synopsis**: Our problem of study revolves around the Grades section on eLC. The Grades section does not clearly reflect a student's standing in a class. Students often must manually make calculations to figure out their current or final overall course grade. A contributing factor to this problem is the fact that the grades table can have widely varying formats from class to class, with some professors not including the weight or category of each assignment, for instance. Contextual variation in the subject of each class and human preference are also contributing factors, as each instructor will have their own personal preferences for the format in which to set up their gradebook. This means that students must contend with these presentation inconsistencies across all courses in order to determine their overall standing in any given course. Instructors would also benefit from a redesign of the gradebook portion, due to saving time using the gradebook and having to answer less grade-reated questions from students. Our group aims to find a design that solves these difficulties and make the eLC grades page easier to use for instructors and more informative for students.
