**Short Synopsis**: Our problem of study revolves around the Grades section on eLC. The Grades section does not clearly reflect a student's standing in a class. Students often must manually make calculations to figure out their current or final overall course grade. A contributing factor to this problem is the fact that the grades table can have varying formats from class to class, with some professors not including the weight of each assignment or any possible dropped assignments. Contextual variation in the subject of each class and human preference are also contributing factors, as different courses may lend themselves to having more or fewer graded assignments with weights varying accordingly, and each instructor will have their own personal preferences for the format in which to set up their gradebook. Students must contend with these presentation inconsistencies across all courses in order to determine their overall standing. Instructors may also benefit from a redesign of the gradebook portion, both in terms of saving time and having to answer less grade-reated questions from studetns.
