## A. User Experience Requirements
### Activities
We have grouped our user stories by activities available. With each group, we highlighted the chosen most relevant stories and provided a brief justification as to why the others were not chosen. Additionally, we provide a more detailed breakdown with justification and evidence provided for each highlighted user story.
#### Activity: viewing grades
- As a student user, I want to view my graded assignments for a class, so that I can know my performance on specific assignments.
- As a student using the eLC gradebook, I want to be able to understand at a glance how much I got on an assignment and how much it is weighted in the category.
- As a student using the eLC gradebook, I want to view the total points available on a numeric assignment as well as the points I earned, so that I can know what percentage I scored.
- As a student using the eLC gradebook, I want to be able to understand my grades clearly so that I know which sections of the class I should focus more on.
- As a student using the eLC gradebook, I want to be able to calculate my current grade so that I know the grades I need to earn in order to obtain a certain letter grade.
- **Strong** As a student user, I want to view my overall calculated grade in a course so that I can understand my overall performance in the class.
