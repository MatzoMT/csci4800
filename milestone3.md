### Ideation
**User Story 1**: As a student user, I want to view my overall calculated grade in a course so that I can understand my overall performance in the class.

Top Ideas:
- Have the overall calculated grade set up to be displayed and updated by default in its own section. 
- Employ a grade calculator built into the eLC grades page to calculate overall grade (both current and potential). 


**User Story 2**: As an instructor user, I want to configure a gradebook with features important to students as well as to myself, so that my students are not confused regarding their grade view, I will have to spend less time answering their questions, and I can match my preferred grading style.

Top Ideas:
- Have certain fields be opt-in instead of opt-out by default, for instance, displaying and updating final grade. 
- Add visuals and colors beyond just a plain text form for the gradebook setup wizard to make the UI clearer and more intuitive.  


**User Story 3**:  As an instructor user, I want some easy sample frameworks available to use so I can choose a functional and user-friendly set-up without having to know every intricacy of eLC.

Top Ideas:
- Have a visual display of cards with sample frameworks to select, which are customizable after selection. 
- Provide clear explanations for which framework or options are best for which use-case, including explanations for student-friendly settings.  


**User Story 4**:  As an instructor user, I want to be able to appropriately categorize a grade item so that I can match my syllabus weighting structure.

Ideation Screenshot:

Top Ideas:
- Provide a form or table page to add categories in bulk/at once, instead of needing to click through the whole menu page for each one.  
- Provide a drag and drop interface to categorize grade items or order the categories. 


**User Story 5**: As an instructor using the eLC gradebook, I want all of the important fields emphasized when creating a grade item so that I do not forget anything and the process is smooth.

Top Ideas:
- Update the UI of the grade item creation page with clearly defined sections (weight, effect on grade, etc.) separated by color or font weight. 
- Display warning messages if certain student-friendly features are missing such as total points are not entered in a numeric assignment, or if item hasn't been categorized.
