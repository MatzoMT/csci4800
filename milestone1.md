# Milestone 1: Problem Proposal
[Back to Home](https://matzomt.github.io/csci4800/)

The Grades section on eLC does not clearly reflect a student's standing in a class. Students often must manually make calculations to figure out their current or final overall course grade. A contributing factor to this problem is the fact that the grades table can have varying formats from class to class, with some professors not including the weight of each assignment or any possible dropped assignments. Contextual variation in the subject of each class and human preference are also contributing factors, as different courses may lend themselves to having more or fewer graded assignments with weights varying accordingly, and each instructor will have their own personal preferences for the format in which to set up their gradebook. 

As students must contend with these presentation inconsistencies across all courses in order to determine their overall standing, they become the most impacted stakeholder in this issue. Professors are also impacted as a stakeholder, because depending on their chosen presentation of the eLC gradebook, they may have to manually calculate students’ final grades, creating more otherwise unnecessary work for them at the end of each semester. Instructors (not just professors, but also TAs) may also be affected negatively if students bombard them with questions about their present academic standing, or when students become reluctant to dedicate more time or attendance in improving their grade in the class, resulting in the professors’ students earning worse grade averages.

This problem is not unique to face-to-face instruction; however, there are cases where an in-person setting may cause further confusion about a student’s standing in the class, such as if students physically turn in assignments or are handed grades on paper that are yet to be reflected in the online gradebook. As another example of the intersection of this problem and face-to-face instruction, knowing an accurate grade may motivate a student to actively come to class and participate, instead of skipping or staying silent in lectures, if the class takes participation and/or attendance into account in the final grade, or if the student would like to be able to meet the professor in person for better communication than what is possible virtually.
